# Greatest-RPG
Hello, this program is "Worlds Greatest RPG",  a small little game I made for my senior project in high school using Python and the Pygame engine.
It's a very simple game. It's a top-down RPG that allows you to freely roam about the room/map and engage in combat with enemies or open chests.
Here's a gif of the character moving around the map and a brief look at the combat:

Here's another gif showing the combat a little bit more:

Here's a gif of the hero opening a chest:

To run this game, you'll need to have a Oython compiler and the Pygame library installed. [Here's a link to the Pygame Website with Instructions](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)

Thank you for looking at my program!
