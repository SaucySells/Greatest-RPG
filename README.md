# Greatest-RPG
Hello, this program is "Worlds Greatest RPG",  a small little game I made for my senior project in high school using Python and the Pygame engine.
It's a very simple game. It's a top-down RPG that allows you to freely roam about the room/map and engage in combat with enemies or open chests.
Here's a gif of the character moving around the map and a brief look at the combat:
